The purpose of fix-term-env is to adjust the TERM environment variable, in
particular with respect to the color depth supported, based on other
environment variables, compatibility with the terminfo database, and any
other clues that can be automatically derived from the system without user
interaction.

To use, simply install fix-term-env somewhere in your PATH and add something
like the following to your ~/.bashrc:

    eval `fix-term-env`

The main motivation is the well-known problem of how best to get 256-color
support from within GNOME Terminal, with the added constraint of detecting
older versions and falling back to a lesser color depth.

A secondary requirement is the ability to demote the color depth based on
the terminfo definitions available on the current system.  This allows, for
example, an ssh session in a 256-color-capable terminal to a machine with an
older terminfo database to automatically reduce the number of colors until
an acceptable terminal setting is found.
